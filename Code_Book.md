# Code Book ( Tidy Data set Description)

# Source Data overveiw
* Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (subject) within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
* Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
* Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity was captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

# Tidy Data set overview
* It contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has average of 66 variable for each activity and each subject.
* It contains only the measurements which were either mean [mean()] or standard deviation [std()] for each 561 measurement in training & testing data set.

# Variable Description

2) subject : Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

3 to 68) :  66 variable which are only mean or standard deviation of 561 measurements of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
